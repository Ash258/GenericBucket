1. Open project settings and **give your bucket in new name**
1. Add proper description of repository
    - Information about what type of manifests could be found here
1. Add `scoop-bucket` tag for repository
    - Your manifests will be automatically available at <https://scoop-docs.now.sh/apps/>
1. Enable appveyor CI/CD
    1. Register / Login to [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/login)
    1. Click `New Project`
    1. From Left Panel, choose your source control variant (Github)

    1. Get Badge URL
        1. Open Appveyor Project settings
        1. Navigate to Badges
        1. Copy `Branch Sample markdown code` snippet for further usage
            - Only master branch is better, since you can freely test in other branches and do not mystificate users
            - [You could use alternative styles](https://shields.io/category/build#styles)
1. Clone project into some folder
    - `git clone git@github.com:USER/REPO.git MyAwesomeBucket`
    - or
    - `git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git MyAwesomeBucket`
1. Open vscode with this clone
